What to work on
===============

There a few API methods that haven't been implemented yet. You can use the
[disclosure by GibSec](http://gibsonsec.org/snapchat/fulldisclosure/) when
implementing the missing methods.

Some of the missing methods are (incomplete list):

* Posting a story
* Deleting story segments
* Reporting snaps or stories as screenshoted
* Clearing your feed
* Get best friends

There's also a need for more tests. More of the API methods should be mocked
and tested.
